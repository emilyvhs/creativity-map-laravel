Want to find a new choir to join or pick up a new creative hobby? 
Interested in what cultural opportunities are available in your local area?

This project is a proof-of-concept to create a functional mapper for creative activities in the UK and Ireland. It aims to address the needs of the following users:

    - Individuals who would like to take part in a new creative activity, and would prefer to see a simple list of all local options rather than navigate algorithmic search engines and social media platforms

    - Creative activity/group leaders who would like to broaden their reach to attract new members through submitting simple directory-style data rather than set up and maintain an additional digital profile/platform

    - Organisers and advocates for widening access to creative participation who would like to gather data on existing availability/types of local creative actities

This project is currently in-progress.
